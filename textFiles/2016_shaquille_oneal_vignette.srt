00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The Shaq is back! Oh, my what a dunk by O'Neal!

1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
He does it all. He is the complete package.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So many moves, so much power.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And it's like a man against boys here tonight.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He will punish you, he's the most dominate player in the game.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hello everybody. Shaquille O'Neal.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Shaquille O'Neal captured the imagination of the basketball world with overwhelming power and unique athleticism for a man of his stature. Becoming a two time consensus first team All American at Louisiana State University.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Every year at Galaxy, he got better.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh, what a pass! Oh!

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
He didn't want to be good, he wanted to great.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But as impressive as he was in college, when O'Neal hit the NBA in the fall of 1992, we would embark on a mission to become one of the most dominate forces ever to play the game.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:13,000
When Shaq came into the league, he had such a great passion and enthusiasm for the game. With his size and strength and mobility, it was something that we really hadn't seen.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
O'Neal runs the floor. Takes it all the way.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He was huge, he was menacing. He really just attacks the rim.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's a man's jam buddy.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Shaquille with a grab for that one. Oh, what a dunk!

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:47,000
After collecting the rookie of the year award in 1993, Shaq would win the first of two scoring titles two years later while carrying the Orlando Magic to the NBA Finals. And establishing himself as one of the most engaging personalities the league has ever seen.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He really just took the league by storm, but he did it in Shaquille O'Neal style. He was just as big off the court as he was on the court and when he went from Orlando to the Lakers, L.A. just loved him.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The more bigger I get, I get strong. And the more strong I get, nobody can stop me.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He's this funny, jovial guy, but in between those lines, I mean he's not playing around.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Shaquille, fade away.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He played with such a viciousness. I've watched him put centers to shame.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Shaq brought a whole different element to basketball. He was gonna be the dominate initial force that we had. He took on the mantle of we have to win, now is the time to win.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Kobe on the move, [crosstalk 00:02:44], to the dunk!

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The 15 time All Star would be named the league's most valuable player in 2000, the same year he won the first of three straight championships and three NBA Finals MVP awards.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
A three-peat for the world champion Los Angeles Lakers!

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He put L.A. back on the map. He brought that belief back to Los Angeles that we're playing for titles and nothing else.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Shag the man. The most dominate player in the world.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Shaquille is one of the great Lakers of all time. Over a ten year period, he was the best center in the league. That is absolutely a mark of greatness.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Upon moving on to Miami, the seventh leading scorer in league history added to his resume with a fourth NBA title in 2006.

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In the history of big win, he's right in that handful of greatest centers ever.

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
To win the championships that he's won, the long career, the impact that he has had on the game.

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Most defensively dominate player ever to play in this game.

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There will never be anybody like Shaquille O'Neal, ever. It won't even be close.
